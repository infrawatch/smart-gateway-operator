              description: Number of messages that we can prefetch from AMQP 1.x.
                By enabling prefetching, the smart gateway won't need to request every
                message individually from the AMQP bus, resulting in a round trip
                for every request between sender and receiver. To avoid the round
                trip for every message, the use of prefetch can be used to allow the
                receiver to request messages be sent in anticipation of them being
                sent to us.
